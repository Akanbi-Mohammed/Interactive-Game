I used three design patterns. 

In task 1, I used the observers pattern where the PlayerLocation class was the subject and the OpenWorld class was the observer.

In task 2, I used the singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the LogAnalytics class was created at all times.

In task 3, I used to the factory design pattern and created a new factory class called Encounter Factory to create new encounters using the encounter classes I created.
